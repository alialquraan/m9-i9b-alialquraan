"""Canonical question shapes + gold Cypher templates (course-provided).

These 15 templates ARE the autograder gold for both the deterministic
mapper and the Tier 3 chain. Do not modify — your `compile_to_cypher`
implementation selects from this dict; your `intent.detect_shape`
classifier returns one of these ShapeId values.

Every template is parameterized with `$param` syntax — never f-string
interpolation of slot values into the query.

Subclass-traversal templates (q4, q6, q12, q13) use `[:SUBCLASS_OF*0..]`
so the answer set includes the named taxon AND all descendants.
